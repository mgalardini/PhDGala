\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First of all I would like to thank my supervisors: Professor \textbf{Marco Bazzicalupo} for his advices, \textbf{Alessio mengoni} and his constant presence and contagious enthusiasm and \textbf{Emanuele Biondi} for the impulse of doing a better and clearer work.

Most of the work of this thesis wouldn't have been made without the experiments and insights of \textbf{Francesco Pini} and the precious advices and long emails of \textbf{Matteo Brilli}. 

I also would like to thank \textbf{Marco Fondi} for the long discussions in front of many cups of coffee, and also for the idea of the "Florence computational biology group" (Combo).

Thanks also to \textbf{Stefano Mocali} for the opportunity to publish the early ideas beyond the development of the "weekend project" DuctApe.

Thanks to my good friend \textbf{Emilio Potenza} for the long video calls and long saturdays and evenings working on small projects and crazy ideas.

Thanks to all of those who have inhabited the Specola during these three years, and especially \textbf{Giovanni Bacci}, \textbf{Angela Frascella}, \textbf{Giulia Spini} and \textbf{Amaranta Focardi} for all the good laughs.

Many thanks to my family which has always supported me in all these long years of neverending studies: I wouldn't have made it without their presence.

Thanks also to all my friends and roommates for all the important moments outside the laboratory, remembering me that work it's not the most important thing to bear in mind.
